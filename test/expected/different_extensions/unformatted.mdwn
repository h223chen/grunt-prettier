> Prettier plugin for Grunt

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5` If you haven't used
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the
[Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how
to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install
and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install
this plugin with this command: `shell npm install grunt-prettier --save-dev`
Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with
this line of JavaScript: `js grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-prettier');`
